“When did you first saw Pikachu on TV?”

“Such a long time ago. I guess it was in my Pre-K, kindergarten era”

“After seeing Pikachu did you get really into Pokemon, or did you only thought Pikachu was cute and liked it because other people were talking about it?”

“I guess both for aesthetical purposes and because I enjoyed watching Pokemon. I also used to watch a lot of Digimon. I liked the background music and I also like the cute animal looking monsters [Mon at the end stands for monsters] And it was a fun adventure for me”

“Have you ever tried to rewatch these shows as you got older?”

“I actually never searched up Pokemon to rewatch during my middle school nor in my high school years, but I remember watching them in my elementary school years whenever they would pop up on TV. And rather than watching the Pokemon series, I used to buy pikachu stationaries (laughs) they are cute!”

“Probably yes, but was pokemon popular among your classmates back in school? Did they have collectionables, cards, etc.?”

“I think they did. But we had a lot of different ones too. A lot of people liked Yu-Gi-Oh (laughs) I also remember watching D. Gray-man during my middle school years.”

[five minutes talking about D. Gray-man because…yeah]

“How do you feel about the [Pokemon] anime hype died off but the games are still really popular? Of course, this happens because they have to further commercialize the brand, but do you feel about appropriating an anime into a game?”

“It think it is a good thing. I don’t have any oppositions to that. I do not see it as a bad thing because, if they are not going to produce a new anime series or a movie that are slightly refreshing and not, you know, same repetitive stories, it is alright since people have kind of move on.”

“Yeah since they already know what the franchise is all about”

“Exactly; they have moved on. I believe it only remains as a good, warm childhood memory to them, like ‘yeah, I had fun watching those’ so I do not see a reason to rewatch. So I think that when Pokemon GO came out it was a good thing since it was AR and it was portable; anyone could download it. It was AR, new technology and a piece of my childhood so it was quite refreshing. Perfect!”

“About that, Nintendo also tried to make Mario [and planning to make Zelda] portable. Like it is bound to happen for them to fuse their already existing games with new technology? But do you think it might make them boom again?”

“Depends on how the game is constructed and in which platform you play the game. I actually played the Mario game. It was fun, but the only difference is that the game was free but you needed to make in-app purchases to progress”

“Having to pay to keep playing…”

“Yeah, I didn’t feel the need to pay”

“So do you feel that took away the joy of playing Mario again? Like monetizing in that way?”

“I really do not like the frame of ‘oh, the capitalist trying to make everything monetized’ because animation itself is monetization of a story. They need to live, earn money to eat. And, okay, you can see everything as greedy, but, so what? I don’t know why people would criticize something on monetizing a product”

“We both are creatives and to some degree we want to make the best work we can, in both financial and recreational scopes. So, over the course of the years, how did you feel before [as a kid] playing these games and know that you are on the other side of entertainment?”

“As a child too, I had the sense of limitation on money, because all the cool, new games had to be bought by my parents. And, of course I was not going to have all the games so I remember feeling sad about the games I couldn’t get. Naturally, money has been ruling how we live since the day we were born. I don’t feel strange because of that but as a child I remember admiring the work and effort put into all these games and even though I had no idea how they make those I was fascinated by them. As I grew up, and now that I am learning how to make those, I still have the same fascination yet it has made me respect some games even more while my views on others simply fell apart.”

“Exactly, like ‘how did it like this before?!’ (laughs)”

“Yeah, I didn’t really play many videogames, so I kind of have nothing more to say (laughs) but I played Minecraft and I still enjoy building things on Minecraft.”

“So, to wrap-up, as a creative, how do you feel about making something out of your favorite childhood stories”

“I can take inspiration from those works and I can apply them to my own [make a tribute even] but, unless the fashion cycle (laughs) brings things back, they kind of change”

“They are reappropriated”

“Yeah, so if we had a newer version of what we had before, no one would want the older version if they had the newer, better one.”

“So, in the case of masterpieces, do you feel they are better in their original state or would they be more appealing in a modern setting”

“I guess that depends of the audience. I was just thinking about Blade Runner 2049 and how I like the first one better [Blade Runner (1982) because of the fact they created that world with props and everything with the technology available back then which struck me so I hold it higher than the recent one even though I enjoyed both. Though it was fun for me to compare this recreated version to the older one.”

“Last question, but do you enjoy comparing things for the sake of it?”

“Of course! Since different versions are inseparable and to see what they kept or change from the original is always interesting to see. The reason why I do this is to figure out or read what the director had in mind because I like to dig into whoever the creator of something is and what try of message are they trying to deliver.”

“Well, thank you so much!”

“It was a pleasure (looks at the recorder) Wow, twenty minutes! (laughs)"
