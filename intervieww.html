<i><div class="question">“When did you first saw Pikachu on TV?”</div></i>

<p>

<b><div class="answer">“Such a long time ago. I guess it was in my Pre-K, kindergarten era”</div></b>

<p>

<i><div class="question">“After seeing Pikachu did you get really into Pokemon, or did you only think that Pikachu
	<br> was cute and liked it because other people were talking about it?”</div></i>

	<p>

<b><div class="answer">“I guess both for aesthetical purposes and because I enjoyed watching Pokemon.
	<br>I also used to watch a lot of <mark><a href="http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Digimon">Digimon</a></mark>. I liked the background music and I also liked
	<br> the cute animal-looking monsters [Mon at the end stands for monsters] And it was a fun adventure for me”</div></b>

	<p>

<i><div class="question">“Have you ever tried to rewatch these shows as you got older?”</div></i>

<p>

<b><div class="answer">“I actually never searched up Pokemon to rewatch during my middle school nor in my high school years,
	<br> but I remember watching them in my elementary school years whenever they would pop up on TV.
	<br>And rather than watching the Pokemon series, I used to buy pikachu stationaries (laughs) they are cute!”</div></b>

<p>

<i><div class="question">“Probably yes, but was pokemon popular among your classmates back in school?
	<br>Did they have collectionables, cards, etc.?”</div></i>

	<p>

<b><div class="answer">“I think they did. But we had a lot of different ones too. A lot of people liked Yu-Gi-Oh (laughs)
	<br>I also remember watching <mark><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/1482/DGray-man">D. Gray-man</a></mark> during my middle school years.”</div></b>

	<p>

<center><del>[five minutes talking about D. Gray-man because…yeah]</del></center>

<p>

<i><div class="question">“How do you feel about the [Pokemon] anime hype died off but the games are still really popular?
	<br> Of course, this happens because they have to further commercialize the brand,
	<br> but do you feel about appropriating an anime into a game?”</div></i>

	<p>

<b><div class="answer">“It think it is a good thing. I don’t have any oppositions to that. I do not see it as a bad thing because,
	<br> if they are not going to produce a new anime series or a movie that are slightly refreshing and not, you know,
	<br> the same repetitive stories, it is alright since people have kind of move on.”</div></b>

	<p>

<i><div class="question">“Yeah since they already know what the franchise is all about”</div></i>

<p>

<b><div class="answer">“Exactly. They have moved on. I believe it only remains as a good, warm childhood memory to them,
	<br> like ‘yeah, I had fun watching those’ so I do not see a reason to rewatch. So I think that when Pokemon GO
	<br> came out it was a good thing since it was AR and it was portable; anyone could download it. It was AR, new technology
	<br>and a piece of my childhood so it was quite refreshing. Perfect!”</div></b>

<p>

<i><div class="question">“About that, Nintendo also tried to make Mario [and planning to make Zelda] portable. Like it is bound to happen for them
	<br> to fuse their already existing games with new technology? But do you think it might make them boom again?”</div></i>

<p>

<b><div class="answer">“Depends on how the game is constructed and in which platform you play the game. I actually played the Mario game.
	<br> It was fun, but the only difference is that the game was free but you needed to make in-app purchases to progress”</div></b>

<p>
	<i><div class="question">“Having to pay to keep playing…”</div></i>

	<p>

	<b><div class="answer">“Yeah, I didn’t feel the need to pay”</div></b>

	<p>

	<i><div class="question">“So do you feel that took away the joy of playing Mario again? Like monetizing in that way?”</div></i>

	<p>

	<b><div class="answer">“I really do not like the frame of ‘oh, the capitalist trying to make everything monetized’ because animation itself
		<br> is monetization of a story. They need to live, earn money to eat. And, okay, you can see everything as greedy, but, so what?
		<br> I don’t know why people would criticize something on monetizing a product”</div></b>

  <i><div class="question">“We both are creatives and to some degree we want to make the best work we can, in both financial and recreational scopes.
	<br> So, over the course of the years, how did you feel before [as a kid] playing these games and know that
	<br>you are on the other side of entertainment?”</div></i>

	<p>

<b><div class="answer">“As a child too, I had the sense of limitation regarding money, because all the cool, new games had to be bought by my parents.
	<br> And, of course I was not going to have all the games so I remember feeling sad about the games I couldn’t get.
	<br>Naturally, money has been ruling how we live since the day we were born. I don’t feel strange because of that
	<br>but as a child I remember admiring the work and effort put into all these games and even though I had no idea how they make those
	<br>I was fascinated by them. As I grew up, and now that I am learning how to make those, I still have the same fascination yet it has made me
	<br> respect some games even more while my views on others simply fell apart.”</div></b>

<p>

<i><div class="question">“Exactly, like ‘how did it like this before?!’ (laughs)”</div></i>

<p>

<b><div class="answer">“Yeah, I didn’t really play many videogames, so I kind of have nothing more to say (laughs)
	<br>but I played Minecraft and I still enjoy building things on Minecraft.”</div></b>

	<p>

<i><div class="question">“So, to wrap-up, as a creative, how do you feel about making something out of your favorite childhood stories”</div></i>

<p>

<b><div class="answer">“I can take inspiration from those works and I can apply them to my own [make a tribute even] but,
	<br> unless the fashion cycle (laughs) brings things back, they kind of change”</div></b>

<p>

<i><div class="question">“They are reappropriated”</div></i>

<p>

<b><div class="answer">“Yeah, so if we had a newer version of what we had before, no one would want the older version if they had the newer, better one.”</div></b>

<p>

<i><div class="question">“So, in the case of masterpieces, do you feel they are better in their original state or would they be more appealing in a contemporary setting”</div></i>

<p>

<b><div class="answer">“I guess that depends of the audience. I was just thinking about Blade Runner 2049 and how I like the first one better [<mark><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blade_runner">Blade Runner 1982</a></mark>]
	<br> because of the fact they created that world with props and everything with the technology available back then which struck me so I hold it higher
	<br> than the recent one even though I enjoyed both. Though it was fun for me to compare this recreated version to the older one.”</div></b>

	<p>

<i><div class="question">“Last question, but do you enjoy comparing things for the sake of it?”</div></i>

<p>

<b><div class="answer">“Of course! Since different versions are inseparable and to see what they kept or change from the original
	<br> is always interesting to see. The reason why I do this is to figure out or read what the director had in mind because
	<br> I like to dig into whoever the creator of something is and what try of message are they trying to deliver.”</div></b>

	<p>

<i><div class="question">“Well, thank you so much!”</div></i>

<p>

<b><div class="answer">“It was a pleasure (looks at the recorder) Wow, twenty minutes! (laughs)"</div></b>
